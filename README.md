# ASR with Bemba language datasets
This repository contains the 2 hours speech recognition dataset recorded in Bemba language. The native language spoken by the majority of people in the north part of Zambia.

- number of recordings made, problems encoutered during recording, comments, etc
- There are 2 hours of recordings in this dataset.

### Problems encountered during recording.
Several challenges were encoutered during the dataset building process:
- The scarcity of the Bemba literature on the internet. But was fortunate to find an online Bible in Bemba language. 
- Difficult to read and pronounce some of the words in Bemba. Surely, this could have negatively affected the quality of recordings.
- The Lig-Aikuma application was crushing during recording sessions. This  slowed the process of recording and frustatitng at times.

### Comments
- Speech recognition course was very interesting especially that it was coupled with a project that gave me the practical aspect of gathering data and come up with speech dataset for ASR.

### Future works
- Having noticed there exist no speech dataset for any Zambia language. I wish to take up a challenge and build the dataset for some of the local language in my country after AMMI.
